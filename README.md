text analysis application

## Writing Aid
Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data.
## MVP
You are required to write an Android app for students who are looking for a writing aid where they can categorise different pieces of writing. They would like to have some common feedback generated for these texts such as the word count as well as extra information that might be helpful to them. 
This app would be used for: 
* diary entries
* Essays
* creative writing pieces. 

The app should help them keep track of statistics that may aid them in their writing. Appropriate feedback might include:
* Popular words
* Readability score
* Sentence length
* Word length

The feedback types should be tailored to the different texts and displayed on a separate screen.

## Project Extensions
* Allow the user to store the texts and the data collected from them. 
* Create a page of totals which accumulate all the data from the different texts stored. 






**This is a work in progress.**
**There are some ongoing bugs that are affecting the readability and syllable counter functions.**
